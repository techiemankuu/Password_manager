In the digital age, the necessity for secure and efficient management of numerous online 
credentials has become increasingly critical. This project presents the design and implementation 
of a Password Manager, a software application aimed at storing, retrieving, editing, and deleting 
user credentials in a secure and user-friendly manner. The Password Manager is built using C++ 
and leverages fundamental data structures and algorithms to ensure efficient operations. At its 
core, it utilizes a singly linked list to manage the dynamically changing set of passwords, 
allowing for fast and straightforward insertion, deletion, and traversal of user credentials.
Key features of the Password Manager include:
1. Add Password : Users can add new credentials comprising a website, username, and 
password. The credentials are stored as nodes in the linked list, facilitating efficient management.
2. Edit Password : Users can update existing passwords, ensuring that credentials remain current 
and secure.
3. Delete Password : The application allows users to delete credentials, providing a method to 
remove outdated or unused entries.
4. Search Password : Users can search for stored credentials by website, allowing quick retrieval 
of usernames and passwords.
5. Display All Passwords : The application can list all stored credentials, enabling users to 
review and manage their data easily.
